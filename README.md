# Bitcoin-rs

Implement Bitcoin in Rust.

The project is based on OReilly's book **Programming Bitcoin**, step by step.

I haven't finished reading the book, now I'm on Chapter 3.

Implemented features:

- Finite Fields
- Elliptic Curve
- Operations for Elliptic Curve over Finite Fields
- SECP256K1 Field and Point
- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
- Signing with private key
